<h1>Clearwater Architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#clearwater-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Clearwater was designed from the ground up to be optimized for
deployment in virtualized and cloud environments. It leans heavily on
established design patterns for building and deploying massively
scalable web applications, adapting these design patterns to fit the
constraints of SIP and IMS. The Clearwater architecture therefore has
some similarities to the traditional IMS architecture but is not
identical.</p>
<p>In particular ...</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All components are horizontally scalable using simple, stateless
load-balancing.</li>
<li>Minimal long-lived state is stored on cluster nodes, avoiding the
need for complex data replication schemes. Most long-lived state is
stored in back-end service nodes using cloud-optimized storage
technologies such as Cassandra.</li>
<li>Interfaces between the front-end SIP components and the back-end
services use RESTful web services interfaces.</li>
<li>Interfaces between the various components use connection pooling with
statistical recycling of connections to ensure load is spread evenly
as nodes are added and removed from each layer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram shows a Clearwater deployment.</p>

<div class="section" id="bono-edge-proxy">
<h2>Bono (Edge Proxy)<a class="headerlink" href="#bono-edge-proxy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Bono nodes form a horizontally scalable SIP edge proxy providing
both a SIP IMS Gm compliant interface and a WebRTC interface to clients.
Client connections are load balanced across the nodes. The Bono node
provides the anchor point for the client&#8217;s connection to the Clearwater
system, including support for various NAT traversal mechanisms. A client
is therefore anchored to a particular Bono node for the duration of its
registration, but can move to another Bono node if the connection or
client fails.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sprout-sip-router">
<h2>Sprout (SIP Router)<a class="headerlink" href="#sprout-sip-router" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Sprout nodes act as a horizontally scalable, combined SIP registrar
and authoritative routing proxy, and handle client authentication and
the ISC interface to application servers. The Sprout nodes also contain
the in-built MMTEL application server. The Sprout cluster includes a
memcached cluster storing client registration data. SIP transactions are
load balanced across the Sprout cluster, so there is no long-lived
association between a client and a particular Sprout node. Sprout uses
web services interfaces provided by Homestead and Homer to retrieve HSS
configuration such as authentication data/user profiles and MMTEL
service settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="homestead-hss-cache">
<h2>Homestead (HSS Cache)<a class="headerlink" href="#homestead-hss-cache" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Homestead provides a web services interface to Sprout for retrieving
authentication credentials and user profile information. It can either
master the data (in which case it exposes a web services provisioning
interface) or can pull the data from an IMS compliant HSS over the Cx
interface. The Homestead nodes run as a cluster using Cassandra as the
store for mastered/cached data.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="homer-xdms">
<h2>Homer (XDMS)<a class="headerlink" href="#homer-xdms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Homer is a standard XDMS used to store MMTEL service settings documents
for each user of the system. Documents are be created, read, updated and
deleted using a standard XCAP interface. As with Homestead, the Homer
nodes runs as a cluster using Cassandra as the data store.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ralf-ctf">
<h2>Ralf (CTF)<a class="headerlink" href="#ralf-ctf" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ralf provides an HTTP API that both Bono and Sprout can use to report
billable events that should be passed to the CDF (Charging Data
Function) over the Rf billing interface. Ralf uses a cluster of
Memcached instances and a cluster of Chronos instances to store and
manage session state, allowing it to conform to the Rf protocol.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ellis">
<h2>Ellis<a class="headerlink" href="#ellis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ellis is a sample provisioning portal providing self sign-up, password
management, line management and control of MMTEL service settings. It is
not intended to be a part of production Clearwater deployments (it is
not easy to horizontally scale because of the MySQL underpinnings for
one thing) but to make the system easy to use out of the box.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="load-balancing">
<h2>Load Balancing<a class="headerlink" href="#load-balancing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In a cloud scalable system like Clearwater load balancing is an
important part of making the system horizontally scale in a robust way.
Clearwater uses a variation on DNS load balancing to ensure even loading
when clusters are being elastically resized to adapt to changes in total
load.</p>
<p>As an example, a single domain name is configured for all the Sprout
nodes. Each Bono node maintains a pool of SIP connections to the Sprout
nodes, with the target node for each connection selected at random from
the list of addresses returned by DNS. Bono selects a connection at
random for each SIP transaction forwarded to Sprout. The connections in
the pool are recycled on failure and periodically, selecting a different
address from the list returned by the DNS server each time.</p>
<p>A similar technique is used for the HTTP connections between Sprout and
Homer/Homestead - each Sprout maintains a pool of connections load
balanced across the Homer/Homestead clusters and periodically forces
these connections to be recycled.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reliability-and-redundancy">
<h2>Reliability and Redundancy<a class="headerlink" href="#reliability-and-redundancy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Traditional telco products achieve reliability using low-level data
replication, often in a one-to-one design. This is both complex and
costly - and does not adapt well to a virtualized/cloud environment.</p>
<p>The Clearwater approach to reliability is to follow common design
patterns for scalable web services - keeping most components largely
stateless and storing long-lived state in specially design reliable,
scalable clustered data stores.</p>
<p>Both Bono and Sprout operate as transaction-stateful rather than
dialog-stateful proxies - transaction state is typically short-lived
compared to dialog state. As the anchor point for client connections for
NAT traversal, the Bono node used remains on the signaling path for the
duration of a SIP dialog. Any individual Sprout node is only in the
signaling path for the initial transaction, and subsequent requests are
routed through the entire Sprout cluster, so failure of a Sprout node
does not cause established SIP dialogs to fail. Long-lived SIP state
such as registration data and event subscription state is stored in a
clustered, redundant shared data store (memcached) so is not tied to any
individual Sprout node.</p>
<p>Homer and Homestead similar only retain local state for pending requests
- all long lived state is stored redundantly in the associated Cassandra
cluster.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cloud-security">
<h2>Cloud Security<a class="headerlink" href="#cloud-security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>SIP communications are divided into a trusted zone (for flows between
Sprout nodes, Bono nodes and trusted application servers) and an
untrusted zone (for message flows between Bono nodes and external
clients or other systems). These zones use different ports allowing the
trusted zone to be isolated using security groups and/or firewall rules,
while standard SIP authentication mechanisms are used to protect the
untrusted ports.</p>
<p>Other interfaces such as the XCAP and Homestead interfaces use a
combination of locked down ports, standard authentication schemes and
shared secret API keys for security.</p>
